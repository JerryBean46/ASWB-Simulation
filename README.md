# ASWB Simulation
If you are interested in replicating the ASWB Simulation from the DeCarlo-Bean article, follow these steps: 

1) Download and install R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (the CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org).
2) Download and install the free Desktop version of RStudio from the RStudio website (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
3) Download the ASWB Simulation file from this repository and save it in a **local folder**. 
4) Open RStudio.
5) You will need to install three packages: mirt, psych, and lessR. Locate the packages tab in the lower right pane of RStudio,
select the Install tab and enter each package name (you will need to install them one-by-one). 
6) Once the packages are installed, use the File menu in RStudio to open the `ASWB Simulation.R` file you saved.
The easiest way to run the script is line by line using the Run command located in the upper right pane. If you are new to R,
there are lots of on-line resources available to you.
7) Contact me if you run into problems
